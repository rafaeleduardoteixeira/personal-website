            I'm Software Engineer, I've degree in "Systems for Internet", I've
            worked with IT 15+, since 2006 when I'd started my university. Iâ€™ve
            having the pleasure of working alongside some incredible engineers,
            designers, business analysts, and product owners. I discovered
            passionate about code standards, ECMAScript and reactive Javascript
            frameworks (Definitely React is more easily).
